#' Helper function to get the intersection of tangents at $x_{j}$ and $x_{j+1}$
#' 
#' @param x A vector of x values of your points. The first element in the vector
#' has smaller x-coordinate. 
#' @param g A fucntion user wants to generate samples from. This function is 
#' used to calculate h(x)=ln(g(x))
#' @return intersection of tangents of $x_{j}$ and $x_{j+1}$ named $z_{j}$
#' @export
zFun <- function(x,g) { }
