## Background

**ars** is an R Package and function which helps implement Adaptive Rejection 
Sampling (ARS) from log-concave density functions. It is based on the paper \href{http://hedibert.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/1992GilksWild.pdf}{Gilks et al.}.

## How to Run this vignette
In R, just run the following code: 
```{r eval=FALSE}
utils::vignette(topic = "ars", package = "ars")
```

## Examples

### Example 1
We can run a sample for a log-concave density function such as the standard 
normal, which is a pre-defined function in R

```{r echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
# Set the seed for reproducibility
# set.seed(0)

# Generate 1000 standard normal N(0,1) random samples from the R 'dnorm' function
# dnorm1000 <- ars(1000,g=dnorm,D=c(-Inf,Inf))

# Produce the histogram of the sampled points to check that the output looks
# valid
# hist(dnorm1000, breaks=30, main="1000 points sampled from N(0,1)")
```

The output can be tested using the code below:

Vignettes are long form documentation commonly included in packages. Because they are part of the distribution of the package, they need to be as compact as possible. The `html_vignette` output type provides a custom style sheet (and tweaks some options) to ensure that the resulting html is as small as possible. The `html_vignette` format:

- Never uses retina figures
- Has a smaller default figure size
- Uses a custom CSS stylesheet instead of the default Twitter Bootstrap style

## Vignette Info

Note the various macros within the `vignette` section of the metadata block above. These are required in order to instruct R how to build the vignette. Note that you should change the `title` field and the `\VignetteIndexEntry` to match the title of your vignette.

## Styles

The `html_vignette` template includes a basic CSS theme. To override this theme you can specify your own CSS in the document metadata as follows:

    output: 
      rmarkdown::html_vignette:
        css: mystyles.css

## Figures

The figure sizes have been customised so that you can easily put two images side-by-side. 

```{r, fig.show='hold'}
plot(1:10)
plot(10:1)
```

You can enable figure captions by `fig_caption: yes` in YAML:

    output:
      rmarkdown::html_vignette:
        fig_caption: yes

Then you can use the chunk option `fig.cap = "Your figure caption."` in **knitr**.

## More Examples

You can write math expressions, e.g. $Y = X\beta + \epsilon$, footnotes^[A footnote here.], and tables, e.g. using `knitr::kable()`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars, 10))
```
